These files are belong to answer of job application.

Because of Tomcat-Glassfish servers errors, i couldn`t test web-application.

Web service soapresponse uses rpc. jax-rpc.jar is not in valid repositories. when jar is added from outside, errors occurs, netbeans closes itself and must be re-install. so i used globalweather web service to show techniques.

I am not master of Spring framework and Hybernate and they both are so deep. I have read too many thing but i need much more time to understand better the logic behind them. I don't want to make mostly copied and pasted works . i couldn`t finish those questions 9-10.

This is all i could done.

Thank you for inviting me meeting and give a chance to answer question. I hope i got chance to work with you. Please let me know about the result of election.

Btw you need maven-2, mysql-6.03. Don`t hesitate to ask anything.
